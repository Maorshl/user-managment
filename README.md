# user-managment

## Technology 

* React-native
* Typescript
* Redux-toolkit

## Screens

* Home - List of users with the option to update or delete them locally, choosing the amount of users displayed in the list.
* Profile - Pixel Perfect profile page with the first user returned from the api.

## Bonus
The profile screen displays a map view only in IOS due to google maps API having to insert credit card to get a key, I implemnted a Map only with Apple Maps.
I didn't manage to add user's location shown on the map due to time shortage, I developed 3 different apps using location sharing and if I had a little more time I would have done it.
